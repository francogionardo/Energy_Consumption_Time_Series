# Regression Analysis and Gradient Descent Demonstration

## Overview

This repository focuses on demonstrating the application of **linear regression** and **gradient descent** to solve prediction problems. The primary use case involves predicting sales based on historical data with lag features. The repository also explores advanced concepts such as iterative prediction, optimization techniques, and potential alternative methods.

## Objectives

1. **Understanding Linear Regression**:
   - Modeling relationships between sales data and lag features.
   - Developing mathematical intuition behind regression equations.

2. **Gradient Descent Implementation**:
   - Deriving cost functions and their partial derivatives.
   - Minimizing errors using iterative weight updates.
   - Visualizing weight adjustments through multiple iterations.

3. **Iterative Prediction**:
   - Using lag variables (e.g., sales from previous days) to predict future sales.
   - Addressing challenges of compounding errors in multi-step forecasts.

4. **Exploring Alternatives**:
   - Investigating other prediction techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, or machine learning models.
   - Comparing regression-based predictions with other methods for better accuracy.
